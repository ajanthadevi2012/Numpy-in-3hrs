# Numpy-in-3hrs

Get started with NumPy in 3 hours. 

Here's a roadmap you can follow the link  https://lnkd.in/gtv8jVPE for Handson demo 

**Hour 1: Introduction to NumPy**

**What is NumPy and why is it important?**

Installation and setup: how to install NumPy and set up your development environment.
N-dimensional arrays: understanding the basics of NumPy's array data structure.
Creating arrays: different ways to create NumPy arrays, including from Python lists and other arrays.
Indexing and slicing: how to access and manipulate elements within a NumPy array.

**Hour 2: NumPy Operations**

Mathematical operations: performing mathematical operations on NumPy arrays, including element-wise arithmetic and linear algebra operations.
Aggregation: how to calculate summary statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation.
Broadcasting: how NumPy can perform arithmetic operations between arrays with different shapes and dimensions.
Sorting and searching: how to sort and search for elements within a NumPy array.

**Hour 3: Advanced Topics**

**Statistical Operations with NumPy:**
Generating random data: NumPy provides several functions to generate random numbers and arrays, such as numpy.random.rand() and numpy.random.randn().
Descriptive statistics: NumPy offers many functions to calculate descriptive statistics of arrays, such as numpy.mean(), numpy.median(), numpy.var(), and numpy.std().
Correlation and Covariance: NumPy provides functions to compute the covariance and correlation coefficients between two arrays. Use numpy.cov() and numpy.corrcoef() for that.

**Linear Algebra Operations with NumPy:**
Creating matrices and vectors: NumPy provides functions to create matrices and vectors such as numpy.array() and numpy.zeros(), numpy.ones().
Matrix operations: NumPy can perform operations on matrices, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using numpy.add(), numpy.subtract(), numpy.multiply() and numpy.divide().
Matrix inversion and determinant: NumPy includes functions to compute the inverse of a matrix using numpy.linalg.inv() and the determinant of a matrix using numpy.linalg.det().

NumPy is a powerful tool, so take the time to practice and experiment with the different features and techniques.
Note that this is just a brief overview of the most important functions and concepts related to statistical and linear algebra operations in NumPy, and there is much more to learn. 
If you have more time, I would recommend exploring these topics further and practicing with different datasets to improve your understanding of how to apply these functions and concepts in real-world scenarios.
